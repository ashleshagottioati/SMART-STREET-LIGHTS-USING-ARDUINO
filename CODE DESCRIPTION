Code Explanation:
Sensors:

LDR: Detects ambient light (day/night).

IR Sensor: Detects vehicles (digital input).

Rain Sensor: Detects moisture (analog input).

Logic Flow:

Daytime: LEDs turn off automatically.

Nighttime:

Rain/Fog: Full brightness (255).

Vehicle Detected: Full brightness for 5 seconds.

No Activity: Dimmed to 20% brightness (PWM value 50).

Customization:

Adjust LDR_THRESHOLD and RAIN_THRESHOLD based on your sensor calibration.

Modify delay(5000) to change how long lights stay bright after vehicle detection.

Circuit Setup:
Connect sensors to Arduino pins as defined.

Use a PWM-enabled pin (e.g., Pin 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, or 11) for LED control.

Power LEDs via a transistor or MOSFET for higher current handling.

This code provides a basic framework for energy-efficient, context-aware street lighting. For advanced features (e.g., IoT integration), add Wi-Fi modules like ESP8266 and cloud communication logic.
