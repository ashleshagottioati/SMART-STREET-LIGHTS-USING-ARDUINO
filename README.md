# SMART-STREET-LIGHTS-USING-ARDUINO
An automated lighting solution that adjusts streetlight intensity using sensors (LDR, IR, rain/fog) and an Arduino controller. It optimizes energy use by brightening lights for traffic/poor weather, dimming them at dawn, and shutting off in daylight. Reduces energy waste by 70%, enhances safety, and is cost-effective for urban/rural areas. Supports IoT and solar upgrades for smarter, greener cities.
